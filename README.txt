Project Description: This project uses the Python programming language, specifically built-in functions, loops, helper functions, and file manipulation to read data from a user-inputted text file and output that data to another text file but reversed. Specifically, the built-in functions .seek(), .tell(), and .read() are used. The program starts the file pointer at the end of the file and reads two bytes at a time and only writes to the file two bytes at a time if those bytes are '\n\r'. Otherwise, one byte is written at a time.

How to run this software: Run py wp1.py inputfilename.txt outputfilename.txt or python wp1.py inputfilename.txt outputfilename.txt in the terminal
